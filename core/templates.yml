# This file is one of the central points in the Shotgun Pipeline Toolkit configuration and
# a counterpart to the folder configuration structure.
#
# The folder structure underneath the project folder is used to create folders on disk -
# templates.yml (this file) refers to those folders. Therefore, the two files need to be
# in sync. This file contains an overview of all locations that are used by Sgtk.
#
# Whenever an app or an engine refers to a location on disk, it is using an entry defined in
# this file. For more information, see the Shotgun Pipeline Toolkit Documentation.

# Include templates and keys for the unreal integration
include: ../env/includes/unreal/templates.yml
# These keys and templates can be overridden here after the include call
